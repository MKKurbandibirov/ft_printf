## üí° About the project:

> _The goal of this project is to implement the printf function._

	You will learn a popular and versatile C function: printf().
	This exercise is an excellent opportunity to improve your programming skills.
	It is of moderate complexity.
	You will learn about the variable functions in C. The key to running ft_printf successfully
	is good structured and extensible code.

More information about the project can be found at  [**subject**](https://github.com/MKKurbandibirov/ft_printf/blob/master/Subject.pdf).


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage:

### Requirements:

The function is written in C and therefore needs the `gcc` compiler and some standard C libraries to execute it.

### Instructions:

**1. Build the project**

To use the function, run the command:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using in code**

To use the function in projects, you must include the appropriate header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
